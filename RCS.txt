Revision Control System (RCS) is an early version control system (VCS). 
It can be thought of as a set of UNIX commands that allow multiple users to develop and maintain program code or documents. 
With RCS, users can make their own revisions of a document, commit changes, and merge them together. 
RCS was originally developed for programs but is also useful for text documents or configuration files that are frequently revised.
